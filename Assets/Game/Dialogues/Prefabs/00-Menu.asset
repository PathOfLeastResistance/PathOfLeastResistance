  m_Phrases:
  - Text: The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that
      provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity,
      among a set of alternative paths. The concept is often used to describe why
      an object or entity takes a given path. The way in which water flows is often
      given as an example for the idea.

  - Text: In physics, the "path of least resistance" is a heuristic from folk physics
      that can sometimes, in very simple situations, describe approximately what
      happens. It is an approximation of the tendency to the least energy state.
