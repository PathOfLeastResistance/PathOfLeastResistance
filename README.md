# PathOfLeastResistance
Hi! 

We are glad to introduce you this electricity puzzle for this GameOff2022 Jam!

Our Team: 

https://twitter.com/JustDrViJ - Dr-ViJ (Victor Grigorev), Development

https://twitter.com/dsapsan - Dmitry Sokolov, Development

https://www.artstation.com/javaresistance - Evgeny Truhin - 3D Artist, Modeling

Polina Grigoreva - Scenario and Cliche idea



And we also used Dalle2 and Midjourney for 2d asset creation + Dr-ViJ as Junior 2D artist that fixes small things (ha-ha, that one who fixes curvy hands made by AI)
All 2d art was made with Midjourney and Dalle2 and then reworked with procreate.

Circuit Simulation: We decided to port Paul Falstad's library CircuitJS for this jam
